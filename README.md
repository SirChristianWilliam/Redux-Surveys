# PROJECT NAME
Weekend-redux-feedback-loop
## Description

This project took me the whole weekend to build! :) Roughly 20-25 hours.

This project was a good wrap up to the last two weeks I've had learning React, Redux, Axios, and the rest that entails. 
I have a great grasp now on the content and am excited to create more applications in the future. 
I designed this app with the intention of the users in mind, as well as for the sanity of the owners of the site. For instance, the use is unable to enter all empty data, is not allowed to spam entries, and the administrator page requires you to confirm whether or not you'd like to delete an entry.

## Installation & Useage

-Make sure to npm install. 
-npm run server
-npm run client

A database called prime_feedback has been provided with example data in the data.sql file.

On load, you will be brought to the feeling page.
You will consequently enter from a number 0-5 on how well you are feeling about the questions. It will ask how you're feeling, how well you're understanding, and how well you feel supported.

After those three are filled in, you will be brought to a comments page where you can enter in any text you want (it does have a limited length though!).
When you're satisfied, you can select next and review what you've entered. Keep in mind, you are also able to click the previous button in the top left of each page (aside from the home page), and can go back and edit your answer. 

When you're satisfied, click submit and your entry will be added to the database. To see the full list of entered data, you can access it by URL http://localhost:3000/?#/admin. 

Here you will have the option to flag rows for further review, as well as delete rows. If you want to add another survey entry, simply select the previous button in the top left of the page until you return to the home page...you'll know you're at the start when you are no longer able to click the previous button.
