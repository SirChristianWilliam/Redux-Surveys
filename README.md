# PROJECT NAME
Weekend-redux-feedback-loop
## Description

This project took me the whole weekend to build! :) Roughly 20-25 hours.

This project was a good wrap up to the last two weeks I've had learning React, Redux, Axios, and the rest that entails. 
I have a great grasp now on the content and am excited to create more applications in the future. 
I designed this app with the intention of the users in mind, as well as for the sanity of the owners of the site. For instance, the use is unable to enter all empty data, is not allowed to spam entries, and the administrator page requires you to confirm whether or not you'd like to delete an entry.

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
